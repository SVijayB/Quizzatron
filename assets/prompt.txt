prompt = f"""
Generate {num_questions} multiple-choice quiz questions on the topic: "{topic}".
- Difficulty level: {difficulty}
- Image-based questions: {image}

HERE ARE THE FORMATTING GUIDELINES FOR THE JSON OUTPUT that you will create
- Each question must have four answer choices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- The correct answer should be randomly placed (not always A).
- Keep language simple and clear.
- Do NOT include unnecessary details—just the question, options, answer, and image description.
- If image-based questions is true, then the "image" field should contain the bing image prompt to obtain said image.
- STICK TO THE FORMAT GIVEN BELOW AND PROVIDE OUTPUT IN THE SAME ORDER! 
- RETURN OUTPUT AS A VALID JSON OBJECT.
- THE JSON OUTPUT SHOULD BE THE EXACT SAME as ONE OF THE TWO EXAMPLES BELOW BASED on the VALUE of "Imaged-based questions"
if it is "True" format it like Example 1, if it is false format is like Example 2

**If "Image-based questions" is "True", format them like this:**

Example 1 JSON:
{{
    "questions": [
        {{
            "index": 1,
            "question": "Which country does this national flag belong to?",
            "options": ["A) India", "B) Japan", "C) Germany", "D) France"],
            "correct_answer": "B",
            "difficulty": "{difficulty}",
            "image": "National flag of Japan"
        }},
        {{
            "index": 2,
            "question": "Which company does this logo represent?",
            "options": ["A) Apple", "B) Tesla", "C) Microsoft", "D) Amazon"],
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "difficulty": "{difficulty}",
            "image": "Microsoft logo"
        }},
        {{
            "index": 3,
            "question": "What is the name of this famous landmark?",
            "options": ["A) Eiffel Tower", "B) Statue of Liberty", "C) Colosseum", "D) Taj Mahal"],
            "correct_answer": "A",
            "difficulty": "{difficulty}",
            "image": "Eiffel Tower"
        }},
        {{
            "index": 4,
            "question": "Who is this person?",
            "options": ["A) Albert Einstein", "B) Isaac Newton", "C) Nikola Tesla", "D) Galileo Galilei"],
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "difficulty": "{difficulty}",
            "image": "Nikola Tesla"
        }}
    ]
}}

**If image-based questions is False, format them as regular text-based questions:**

Example 2 JSON: 

{{
    "questions": [
        {{
            "index": 1,
            "question": "What is the capital of France?",
            "options": ["A) Berlin", "B) Madrid", "C) Paris", "D) Rome"],
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "difficulty": "{difficulty}",
            "image": false
        }},
        {{
            "index": 2,
            "question": "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?",
            "options": ["A) Venus", "B) Mars", "C) Jupiter", "D) Saturn"],
            "correct_answer": "B",
            "difficulty": "{difficulty}",
            "image": false
        }}
    ]
}}

**Rules:**
1. **DO NOT include any extra text**—only return a valid JSON object.
2. **Ensure JSON syntax is correct** (use proper commas, brackets, and escape characters if necessary).
3. If `"image"` is **true**, it should contain a **short label** (e.g., `"National flag of Japan"`).
4. Image-based questions should **match the image description**.
5. If `"image": false`, generate **only standard text-based questions**.
"""

LASTLY validate the output you generated with the format provided in the prompt,
just test and ensure if it matches, else fix the JSON so that it is correct
