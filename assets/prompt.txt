**Formatting Guidelines:**
- Each question must have four answer choices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- The correct answer should be randomly placed (not always A).
- Keep language simple and clear.
- Do NOT include unnecessary details—just the question, options, answer, and image description.
- If image-based questions is true, then the "image" field should contain the bing image prompt to obtain said image.
- STICK TO THE FORMAT GIVEN BELOW AND PROVIDE OUTPUT IN THE SAME ORDER!
- RETURN OUTPUT AS A VALID JSON OBJECT.

**If image-based questions is true, format them like this:**

    "questions": [
        {{

            "question": "Which country does this national flag belong to?",
            "options": ["A) India", "B) Japan", "C) Germany", "D) France"],
            "correct_answer": "B",
            "difficulty": "{difficulty}",
            "image": "National flag of Japan"
        }},
        {{

        }}
    ]
}}

**If image-based questions is flase, format them as regular text-based questions:**

Example JSON:
{{
    "questions": [
        {{
            "index": 1,
            "question": "What is the capital of France?",
            "options": ["A) Berlin", "B) Madrid", "C) Paris", "D) Rome"],
            "correct_answer": "C",
            "difficulty": "{difficulty}",
            "image": false
        }},
        {{
            "index": 2,
            "question": "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?",
            "options": ["A) Venus", "B) Mars", "C) Jupiter", "D) Saturn"],
            "correct_answer": "B",
            "difficulty": "{difficulty}",
            "image": false
        }}
    ]
}}

**Rules:**
1. **DO NOT include any extra text**—only return a valid JSON object.
2. **Ensure JSON syntax is correct** (use proper commas, brackets, and escape characters if necessary).
3. If `"image"` is **true**, it should contain a **short label** (e.g., `"National flag of Japan"`).
4. Image-based questions should **match the image description**.
5. If `"image": false`, generate **only standard text-based questions**.
